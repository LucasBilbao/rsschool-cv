I wish to learn many new and interesting things and starting a job as Junior Developer would be a great experience. Developing would be a pleasent working environment for me. I love to learn and surround myself with people I can learn from and maybe sometimes teach too.

I am very stubborn, when I put my mind to something my wish is to accomplish. My word is very important to me and I always keep it.

I have some experience with C++ and JavaScript and am great at problem solving.

I study Mathematics at Tbilisi State Univarsity of Georgia.

I speak 3 languages, I was taught Georgian at school, Greek since I was born there and can communicate easily and last English which I've learnt at school and with private tutors.
